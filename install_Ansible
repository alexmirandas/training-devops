1.- Install Ansible on the control host.

	sudo yum install epel-release
		** wget https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-7.noarch.rpm

	sudo yum install ansible

	sudo ansible --version

2.- Create an `ansible` user on both the control host and workstation host being sure to set a password you can remember.

	On each host, run the noted commands below. Make sure you set a password you can remember (you will need it later).

	sudo useradd ansible

	sudo passwd ansible

3.- Configure a pre-shared key for Ansible that allows the user to log in from `control` to `workstation` without a password.

	sudo -i -u ansible (provide cloud_user a sudo password)

	ssh-keygen (accept default options by pressing enter )

	ssh-copy-id hostnae || ip_node (provide ansible user a password)

	ssh hostnae || ip_node   (Comprobate access)

	logout

4.- Configure the Ansible user on the workstation host so that Ansible may sudo without a password.

	sudo visudo
		Add text at the end of the file that is opened:
		ansible ALL=(ALL)       NOPASSWD: ALL
		Save file:
		(:wq in vim)

5.- Create a simple inventory in `/home/ansible/inventory` consisting of only the `workstation` host.
